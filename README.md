# Rock vs Mine Prediction with Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether an object detected through sonar signals is a "rock" or a "mine" using logistic regression. The goal is to develop a model that can effectively distinguish between natural rocks and man-made mines in underwater environments.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains labeled examples, each characterized by features extracted from sonar signals. The labels are binary, with 'R' representing rocks and 'M' representing mines.

## Logistic Regression Model

Logistic regression is employed as a binary classification algorithm to model the probability of an object being a mine given its sonar signal features.

### Training
The logistic regression model is trained using a labeled dataset, where it learns the relationship between sonar signal features and corresponding class labels ('R' or 'M'). The training process involves adjusting model parameters to minimize the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels.

### Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated on a separate dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the confusion matrix.
